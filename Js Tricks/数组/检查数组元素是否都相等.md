title: 检查数组元素是否都相等
tags: array
---

- Use `Array.prototype.every()` to check if all the elements of the array are the same as the first one.
- Elements in the array are compared using the strict comparison operator, which does not account for `NaN` self-inequality.

```js
const allEqual = (arr) => arr.every((val) => val === arr[0]);
```

```js
allEqual([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); // false
allEqual([1, 1, 1, 1]); // true
```
